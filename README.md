# LevelUp-Study-Focus-App

## Project Overview
The **Level Up Focus App** is a productivity tool designed to help users maintain focus during study or work sessions. It uses a timer to guide users through different mental states, accompanied by audio alerts to signify progress.

---

## How It Works
1. The app starts a timer and tracks elapsed time.
2. Based on the time spent focusing, the user "levels up" through five mental states:
   - **Level 0**: Empty Mind  
   - **Level 1**: Monkey Mind  
   - **Level 2**: Beginner Mind  
   - **Level 3**: Quiet Mind  
   - **Level 4**: Awakened Mind  
   - **Level 5**: No Mind  
3. Each level triggers a sound alert and updates the interface with the current level name.

## Features
- **Simple and clean user interface** using Tkinter.
- **Audio alerts** to notify users of progress.
- **Reset option** to restart focus sessions.
- **Visual time tracker** displaying hours, minutes, and seconds.

## Project Files
- `levelup.py`: The main Python script for the app.
- `alert/` folder: Contains sound files for level transitions.

---

## Requirements
- **Python**.

  - `tkinter`
  - `pygame`
  - `threading`
- **Sound files** placed inside the `alert/` folder.
