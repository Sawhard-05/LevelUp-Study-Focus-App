# LevelUp-Study-Focus-App

## Project Overview
The **Level Up Focus App** is a productivity tool designed to help users maintain focus during study or work sessions. It uses a timer to guide users through different mental states, accompanied by audio alerts to signify progress.

---

## How It Works
1. The app starts a timer and tracks elapsed time.
2. Based on the time spent focusing, the user "levels up" through five mental states:
   - **Level 0**: Empty Mind  
   - **Level 1**: Monkey Mind  
   - **Level 2**: Beginner Mind  
   - **Level 3**: Quiet Mind  
   - **Level 4**: Awakened Mind  
   - **Level 5**: No Mind  
3. Each level triggers a sound alert and updates the interface with the current level name.

## Features
- **Dynamic Level Progression**: Guides users through five unique mental states, encouraging focus and mindfulness.
- **Custom Audio Alerts**: Each mental state is paired with a distinct sound, providing auditory cues for progress.
- **Minimalist Design**: A clean, distraction-free interface designed using Tkinter for an immersive focus experience.
- **Real-Time Timer**: Displays hours, minutes, and seconds to keep track of your focus sessions.
- **Interactive Controls**: Includes a "Start Focus Session" button to begin and a "Reset Timer" button to restart effortlessly.
